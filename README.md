# NEURONswap Introduction

NEURONswap is an innovative decentralized financial protocol based on the Klaytn mainnet that introduces "**Metanance"** for the first time in the world.

NEURONswap team develops the protocol with two missions.&#x20;

The first mission is the realization of a fully decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) based on Metanance and popularize a new governance model by implementing a DAO digitally.&#x20;

The second mission is to develop an interswap which is compatible with all mainnet networks. Interswap will revolutionize the movement and trading of crypto assets, speeding up the popularization of decentralized financial services.
