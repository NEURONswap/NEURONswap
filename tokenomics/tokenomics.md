Liquidity providers create a trading environment in the DEX ecosystem. Liquidity providers are allocated 90% of the daily community token distribution.

### **Trader**

Traders are allocated 10% of the daily community token distribution.

### Governance Member

Governance Token Stakers share the mid- to long-term vision of NEURONswap. After the launch of the staking service, token stakers are allocated a portion of the daily community token distribution.



_\*Token distribution for governance token staking will be applied after the introduction of staking._

_\*The token distribution portion may be adjusted according to the market environment._

## **Deflation Model**

NEURONswap has different buyback systems as the protocol grows. The systems are designed as a virtuous cycle ecosystem that encourages liquidity providers and traders to participate more in the ecosystem by continuously increasing the value of the NR token.

* Burn 90% of Transaction Fee(NR Token)
* Burn NR tokens used to create liquidity pool
* Burn NR tokens from Rony Box sale
* Burn airdrop NR tokens
* Burn NR token caused by unstake penalty
* 5 Deflations throughout the distribution
