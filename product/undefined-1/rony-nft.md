# Rony NFT

## **NFT Paradigm Shift**

#### From Top-down to Bottom-up

Recently, professional creators such as illustrators and graphic artists, as well as the general public’s interest in NFT are increasing.&#x20;

While the demand for NFT minting is increasing, NFT production is too expensive for a lot of people because it requires knowledge of smart contracts or can only be produced by developers who know how to handle smart contracts. There are great hurdles in NFT production, so all existing NFT projects are operated in a Top-down manner in which the project team creates the NFT and all users can do is purchase.

Rony Club is moving away from the Top-down method that is a characteristic of the current NFT market, and aims for a Bottom-up method in which community decisions create value.
