# Metanance

**Metanance** is a compound word of meta(meaning virtuality) and governance which refers to "governance in virtual space(metaverse)‚Äù. In the metaverse, governance members can communicate through their avatars about organizational rules, economy, technology and make proposals, debate, vote and decide.

Digital citizens from all over the world can acquire NR tokens through labor or capital contributions to the NEURONswap protocol and participate in the governance by staking their tokens. As the owners of the protocol they can decide how to operate and develop the protocol.

Metanance in Neuron protocol will let governance members be able to go beyond two dimensional text based communication and have three dimensional communication such as facial expressions, movements and voices through their avatars to decide organizational rules, economy and technology.

In addition, the rules of governance will continue to be developed through smart contracts and blockchain-based voting which is anonymous, transparent and independent from the development team

A new type of future digital organizations operated through Metanance will have its unique culture, meme, sense of belongings and laws. Metanance will be the basis for building a digital city and a digital nation without a distinction of race, country, or religion.
